# frida
An ethernet over usb implementation for STM32

### Overview of Frida Library Components

#### 1. **Core Library (`frida.c`, `frida.h`)**
   - These files are likely the heart of the Frida project, containing the main functions and integrations. Typically, they would initialize the library, set up configurations, and provide interfaces to other modules.

#### 2. **Event Handling (`eventHandler.c`, `eventHandler.h`)**
   - Handles asynchronous events or callbacks from different modules like USB or network services. This could involve managing events such as USB device connection/disconnection, network requests, or file system events.

#### 3. **File System (`fatfs` directory)**
   - Manages file operations on FAT file systems, which are commonly used in embedded systems for their simplicity. This could include reading, writing, deleting files, and manipulating directories.

#### 4. **USB Communication (`usb` directory)**
   - Manages USB functionalities, possibly including USB host and device configurations, handling USB endpoints, and data transfer protocols.

#### 5. **Web Server (`websrv` directory)**
   - Utilizes possibly Mongoose-based components to handle HTTP requests and responses, serving web pages or APIs directly from the embedded device. It could also handle other network protocols as per the components like `dnserver.h` for DNS and `dhserver.h` for DHCP, which suggest network management capabilities.

#### 6. **Mass Storage (`msc_disk.c`)**
   - Provides functionalities to manage mass storage devices like USB flash drives, making the device act as a USB host or device for mass storage purposes.

#### 7. **Configuration (`tusb_config.h`)**
   - Contains configuration settings for TinyUSB, a high-quality USB host/device software stack that is commonly used in embedded systems to provide USB functionalities.

### How it Works

The Frida library likely works by integrating these components into a cohesive framework where each module can be initialized and used independently or in combination depending on the application requirements. For example:

1. **Initialization**: The library might begin with initializing the hardware and software resources, setting up interrupts, and configuring peripheral interfaces.
2. **Module Integration**: Each module such as USB, web server, or file system operates by interfacing directly with the hardware through device drivers and managing data flow between the hardware and the application layer.
3. **Event Management**: As events occur (e.g., a new USB device is connected, a file is requested via the web server), the event handling module dispatches these events to the appropriate handlers which process the input and generate the necessary output.
